## **Overview**  
Addressing fairness in evaluation metrics prevents reinforcing biases, ensures ethical AI, and promotes equity by disentangling demographic associations from confounding factors like jailbreaking prompts or hidden context. Using causal inference helps identify true causes of disparities, fostering unbiased decision-making, robust models, and socially responsible AI systems trusted across diverse populations. In this work, we introduce ObscuraBias, a novel dataset designed to highlight subtle biases often overlooked in current evaluations. Additionally, we propose a groundbreaking metric for assessing the fairness of existing standard evaluation metrics‚Äîsuch as toxicity and regard‚Äîthrough the lens of causal inference, providing a more robust framework to validate and improve fairness in model assessments.

## **Features**  
- üöÄ **Datasets**: ObscuraBias datasets boasts 4 intersectional biases spanning over 15 different demographies which are often overlooked like 'economic_status' and 'gender', 'physical appearance' and 'gender' with an additional context dimension to get more understanding on the prompts. 
- üîç **Evaluation Metric**: Tests the interefence of other factors like context with the causations of intersections (gender, appearance)  and bias evaluation metrics (toxicity, regard). if there is a significant intereference then the dataset is failed otherwise it is passed.
